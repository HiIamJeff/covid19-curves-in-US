# Spotting the Curves in the US
**A Better Overview of COVID-19 in Each State of the United States**

<img src="https://github.com/HiIamJeff/covid19-curves-in-US/blob/master/assets/web_example.png"/>

## Purpose and Features
To better understand COVID-19 in the US, this dashboard presents an overview of state-level data with complementary information. This dashboard aims to show individual trends within each state, extract timely state-level phase information and **provide a consistent and easy-to-read platform other than media outlets**.

## How to run this
The demo requires Python 3.6+. I would suggest creating a new virtual environment, then running:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HiIamJeff/covid19-curves-in-US
cd covid19-curves-in-US
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run app.py
```
